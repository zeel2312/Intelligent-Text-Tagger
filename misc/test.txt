Recall may be thought of as a measure of a classifier's completeness which gives us the proportion
of actual positive which is identified correctly by the predicted classifier. It is the ratio of correct positive
instances and combines with correct positive and wrong positive. It is also called Sensitivity. If recall
returns us a low recall value, then it indicates many False NegativesIn an uneven class distribution, F1 is a good choice as a performance metric. It is the weighted
average of both properties, Recall and Precision. This performance metric takes both false negatives
and false positives into the calculation.
