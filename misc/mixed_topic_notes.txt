Project Notes - Mixed Topics Experiment

Section 1: Team Updates
Today the QA automation team finalized the Supabase migration scripts. 
However, blockchain integration remains blocked due to missing credentials.
Langfuse metrics were discussed briefly but postponed to next sprint.

Section 2: Design Brainstorm
We sketched a prototype for an internal meme sentiment analyzer — 
similar to SentiMeme but focused on textual sarcasm detection rather than images. 
The design document includes ideas for embedding pipelines, pgvector indexes, 
and lightweight FastAPI endpoints for asynchronous inference.

Section 3: Support Log
A customer reported that uploading 8MB .png files fails intermittently.
The support ticket references timeout errors and inconsistent compression logs.
We may need to check Docker resource limits and verify Nginx proxy timeouts.

Section 4: Marketing Draft
The marketing copy mentions Supabase multiple times as our storage partner. 
That repetition might dilute its TF-IDF importance but still tests weighting logic. 
We also added placeholder text, lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, 
to simulate generic boilerplate sections in real documents.

Conclusion
Overall, these notes intentionally mix unrelated contexts — QA, 
design, support, and marketing — to test how the Intelligent Text Tagger 
handles overlapping terms, repeated phrases, and rare domain-specific keywords 
like "pgvector", "Langfuse", and "sarcasm detection".
